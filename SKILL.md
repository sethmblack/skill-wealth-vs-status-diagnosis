# Wealth vs. Status Diagnosis

Distinguish between activities that build real wealth (assets that compound) versus those that chase status (zero-sum social ranking), following Naval Ravikant's framework for escaping status games.

**Token Budget:** ~1000 tokens

---

## Constraints
- Do NOT dismiss all status as worthless (some is instrumentally useful)
- Do NOT encourage hoarding or anti-social wealth accumulation
- Acknowledge that status and wealth can overlap
- Be honest about the difficulty of escaping status games

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Am I chasing status or wealth?"
- User is deciding between prestige and ownership
- User feels competitive or resentful of others' success
- User is optimizing for appearances over outcomes
- User is choosing between recognition and equity

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Decision or goal | Yes | What the user is considering or pursuing |
| Motivation | Helpful | Why they want this |
| Comparison context | Optional | Who they're comparing themselves to |

---

## The Core Framework

### Wealth
- Assets that earn while you sleep
- Positive-sum: your success doesn't require others' failure
- Compounds over time
- Creates freedom

### Status
- Your ranking in a social hierarchy
- Zero-sum: you rise only when others fall
- Requires constant maintenance
- Creates dependency on others' opinions

**Key insight:** "Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Status is your place in the social hierarchy."

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: The Ownership Test

Ask: "Does this create something I own that generates value without my ongoing effort?"

| Answer | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Yes - I'm building an asset | Likely wealth |
| No - I'm building reputation/recognition | Likely status |
| Mixed - I need recognition to build assets | Evaluate the ratio |

### Step 2: The Zero-Sum Test

Ask: "If I succeed at this, must someone else lose?"

| Answer | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| No - value is created | Wealth game |
| Yes - ranking shifts | Status game |
| I'll only be happy if I beat X | Status trap |

### Step 3: The Resentment Test

Ask: "Would others' success in this area make me resentful or inspired?"

| Answer | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Inspired - their success shows it's possible | Wealth mindset |
| Resentful - their success threatens mine | Status mindset |
| Depends on who it is | Status creeping in |

### Step 4: The Sustainability Test

Ask: "What happens if I stop actively maintaining this?"

| Answer | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| It continues generating value | Wealth (assets compound) |
| It decays without attention | Status (requires maintenance) |
| I lose my position to someone else | Pure status game |

### Step 5: The Long-Term Game Check

Ask: "In 10 years, will this have compounded or needed constant renewal?"

| Wealth compounds | Status requires renewal |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Investments grow | Titles need defending |
| Products earn passively | Recognition fades |
| Skills deepen | Rankings shift |

## Output Format

```markdown
## Wealth vs. Status Diagnosis

### The Situation
{Summary of what user is pursuing}

### Diagnosis

| Test | Result | Implication |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Ownership | {owns asset / builds reputation} | {wealth/status} |
| Zero-Sum | {creates value / shifts ranking} | {wealth/status} |
| Resentment | {inspired / resentful by others} | {wealth/status} |
| Sustainability | {compounds / decays} | {wealth/status} |

### Verdict: {WEALTH / STATUS / MIXED}

### The Reframe
{How to shift this toward wealth if it's currently status}

### The Question to Ask
{A specific question to keep them honest about their motivations}
```

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**User:** "I'm deciding between becoming a partner at my law firm or starting my own practice. The partner track is more prestigious but starting my own would give me equity."

**Skill Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Wealth vs. Status Diagnosis

### The Situation
Partner at established firm vs. founder of own practice

### Diagnosis

| Test | Result | Implication |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Ownership | Partner = status/title; Founder = equity | Wealth favors founding |
| Zero-Sum | Partner slots are limited; clients are not | Partnership is more zero-sum |
| Resentment | "I need to make partner before X" | Status language detected |
| Sustainability | Partner title maintained by firm politics; equity compounds | Equity wins long-term |

### Verdict: STATUS (partnership) vs. WEALTH (founding)

### The Reframe
The partner title is a status marker. It says "I rose through the hierarchy." But you don't own anything - you're a highly-paid employee with a fancy title. Starting your practice means you own the outcomes. Your clients become assets that compound. Your reputation becomes your equity, not your employer's brand.

The question isn't "which is more prestigious?" That's status thinking. The question is: "Which builds something I own that earns while I sleep?"

### The Question to Ask
"In 20 years, do I want to have built something or to have risen through someone else's ranks?"

## Integration

This skill is part of the Naval Ravikant expert. After diagnosis, consider:

- **Specific Knowledge Discovery** - Find what's uniquely yours to build
- **Leverage Audit** - Ensure you're applying leverage to wealth, not status
- **Long-Term Game Analysis** - Build compounding relationships, not competitive ones

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Status genuinely required for wealth | Acknowledge - some status is instrumentally useful |
| User defensive about status pursuit | Don't judge; diagnose honestly |
| Unclear whether wealth or status | Look at what compounds vs. decays |
| User in status-heavy industry | Help find wealth-building within constraints |
